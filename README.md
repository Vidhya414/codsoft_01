Titanic Survival Prediction
This project builds a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginner project with readily available data. The dataset typically used for this project contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze historical data of Titanic passengers and develop a model that accurately estimates the survival likelihood of passengers. This project involves exploring data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling techniques. It provides insights into the factors that influenced survival and allows us to build a predictive model.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes the following features:

pclass: Passenger class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd)
sex: Gender of the passenger
age: Age of the passenger
sibsp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic
parch: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic
fare: Ticket fare
cabin: Cabin number
embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Steps Involved
Data Loading: Load the Titanic dataset using Python libraries.
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing data, encode categorical variables, and select relevant features.
Feature Engineering: Create new features or modify existing ones to improve the predictive power of the model.
Model Building: Train a machine learning model using the preprocessed data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using appropriate metrics.
Prediction: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.
